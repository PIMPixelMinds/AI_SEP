# MS Relapse AI

This project uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapse. 
To run the project, clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/PIMPixelMinds/AI_SEP.git`),
 navigate to the folder, create a virtual environment (optional), and install the required packages using `pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib`. 
You can then execute `predict.py` to get predictions based on input features. To retrain the model, run `train_model.py` using the provided synthetic dataset.
 Make sure Python is installed and the current working directory contains all project files.
